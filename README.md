# Smart Indoor Plant Care and Watering System
## CITS5506 The Internet of Things, The University of Western Australia
This repository provides the code for the monitoring and watering system, utilising Arduino Cloud. Note that the `thingProperties.h` file was automatically generated by the cloud editor.

The code effectively runs directly from the cloud editor but if using the Arduino IDE, you would need to download the relevant libraries needed to connect to the Arduino Cloud. Please see [here](https://docs.arduino.cc/arduino-cloud/cloud-interface/sketches/) for the documentation to setup offline sketches.
